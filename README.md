# Overview 
FlipMindsOdyssey is a card-based memory game that tests a players memory skills by flipping over cards to find matching pairs. This game is simple and engaging & can be played by everyone regardless of age.

FLipMindsOdyssey was made using the Unity engine.

# Features
Some features that this game has include:
- Card Matching: Players flip over 2 cards at a time to see if the pairs match. 
- Timer: Players can challenge themselves to match all the pairs of cards before time runs out.
- Score/Attempts Counter: Players will get a score when they get a matching pair. When all of the cards have a matching pair, a total score with how many attempts were taken would be revealed.
- Level Select: Players can select any of the levels to play on whether it is to complete a level, attempt a speedrun, or even admire the background images and music that were used to create this game. You can either go forward a level, go backwards a level,  or you can restart on a level that you were already on.
- Modes: There are two different modes: Easy Mode & Hard Mode. When you start playing the game, you will complete the easier scenes of the game. Once players have completed all of the easier scenes, they will then load into a harder version of the scenes and can select different scenes of the hard mode. This hard mode can range from different card faces to a timer countdown where you have a certain amount of time to complete the level before time runs out.  
- UI: Players can interact with the main menu UI when needed. This can range starting the game by selecting a level to start from, turning the music on or off and quiiting the game. You can even change the volume of the music if it's either too loud or too quiet.  
- Music: Players can enjoy listening to the music that brings a calm aesthetic to the game. They can either vibe to the music playing in the background or turn it off and try to focus on the memory game to get a good score.
